# Various python / shell scripts created for my work.

I would like to convert as many of these scripts to python as possible.

## TODO
* Convert many utilities to broad-scope qcl package
* Do away with lib/python -> qcl
* scripts/lib/bash -> scripts
** scripts can act as a lib path as well (e.g. PYTHONPATH)
